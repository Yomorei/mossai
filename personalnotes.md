my personal thoughts, explinations, and suggestions.

for now since this is a prototype to really steer this project in the right direction i wont be splitting CSS/JS into modules. 

The main point of todays work was to get a baseplate to build off of, it's a low-effort frontend intergration. Once I get a better sense of direction for design and features I think then I can open a PR. I'd like to get this finished sometime last year hopefully.
